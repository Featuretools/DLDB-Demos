# DLDB Demos

Examples of how to use DLDB (deep learning for complex, multitable datasets).

The actual repository is [here](https://github.com/Featuretools/DL-DB)

Check out:

 * this [demo](Backblaze%20Demo%20-%20DFS.ipynb) using feature produced by DFS and Featuretools to learn a hard drive failure model
 * this [demo](Backblaze%20Demo%20-%20Denormalized.ipynb) on the same data without DFS features
 * this [demo](Instacart%20Demo%20DFS.ipynb) on Instacart online grocery shopping prediction (with DFS features)
 * this [demo](Backblaze%20Demo%20-%20Denormalized.ipynb) on Instacart data (without DFS features).
